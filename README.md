# Hotel_booking

Hotel Booking Website
This project is a hotel booking website where users can search for hotels, book rooms, and make payments using Stripe. The frontend is built using React with Bootstrap for styling, and the backend is implemented using Node.js, Express, MongoDB for database management, JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, Morgan for logging, and Stripe for handling payments.

Features
Search Hotels: Users can search for hotels based on various criteria such as location, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, etc.

Book Hotels: Once a user has found a suitable hotel, they can select the room type and proceed with the booking process.

Payments with Stripe: Users can make secure payments using the Stripe payment gateway.

Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to their accounts. JWT is used to handle authentication.

Authorization: Certain routes and features are protected and only accessible to authenticated users.
